NAME

    Test::Perl::Critic::XTFiles - Perl::Critic test with XT::Files
    interface

VERSION

    Version 0.001

SYNOPSIS

        use Test::Perl::Critic::XTFiles;
        Test::Perl::Critic::XTFiles->new->all_files_ok;

        use Perl::Critic;
        use Test::Perl::Critic::XTFiles;
        Test::Perl::Critic::XTFiles->new(
            critic => Perl::Critic->new( -profile => 'xt/author/perlcritic.rc' ),
        )->all_files_ok;

DESCRIPTION

    Tests all the files supplied from XT::Files with Perl::Critic. The
    output, and behavior, should be the same as from Test::Perl::Critic.

USAGE

 new( [ ARGS ] )

    Returns a new Test::Perl::Critic::XTFiles instance. new takes an
    optional hash or list with its arguments.

        Test::Perl::Critic::XTFiles->new(
            critic => Perl::Critic->new( -profile => '.perltidyrc' ),
            critic_test => Perl::Critic->new( -profile => '.perltidyrc-tests' ),
        );

    The following arguments are supported:

  critic, critic_module, critic_script, critic_test (optional)

    Sets the default Perl::Critic object and the objects used to test
    module, script or test files. See the method with the same name for
    further explanation.

 all_file_ok

    Calls the files method of Test::XTFiles to get all the files to be
    tested. All files are tested with the Perl::Critic object configured
    for their type.

    It calls done_testing or skip_all so you can't have already called
    plan.

    all_files_ok returns something true if all files test ok and false
    otherwise.

    Please see XT::Files for how to configure the files to be checked.

 critic

    Returns, and optionally sets, the Perl::Critic default object. This is
    only used to initialize the other critic_* methods. On first access
    this is initialized to Perl::Critic-new()>.

 critic_module( [ARGS] )

    Returns, and optionally sets, the Perl::Critic object used to test
    module files. On first access this is initialized to $self-critic()>.

 critic_script( [ARGS] )

    Returns, and optionally sets, the Perl::Critic object used to test
    script files. On first access this is initialized to $self-critic()>.

 critic_test( [ARGS] )

    Returns, and optionally sets, the Perl::Critic object used to test test
    files. On first access this is initialized to $self-critic()>.

EXAMPLES

 Example 1 Default usage

    Check all the files returned by XT::Files with Perl::Critic.

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::Perl::Critic::XTFiles;

        Test::Perl::Critic::XTFiles->new->all_files_ok;

 Example 2 Check non-default directories or files

    Use the same test file as in Example 1 and create a .xtfilesrc config
    file in the root directory of your distribution.

        [Dirs]
        module = lib
        module = tools
        module = corpus/hello

        [Files]
        module = corpus/world.pm

 Example 3 Use a different Perl::Critic config file for script files

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Perl::Critic;
        use Test::Perl::Critic::XTFiles;

        Test::Perl::Critic::XTFiles->new(
            critic_script => Perl::Critic->new( -profile => '.perlcriticrc-scripts' ),
        )->all_files_ok;
